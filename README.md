# CS171-Final-Project

## We have implemented Paxos using 5 servers, a network delay process, and a client process.
## To run the program do the following:
* run networkprocess.py first
* run server.py with 0,1,2,3,4 as the command line arguments where each number represents a different server.
* run client.py to connect to network process and you can start sending transactions

### NOTE
* when running client.py there is functionality to printBlockchain, printSet, printBalance and moneyTransfer. It is important for the first 3 you signify which server you're trying to get information from by typing ***command*** serverName(as a letter)
